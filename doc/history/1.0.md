# 0.8.0-RC1 ([commit log](https://github.com/japgolly/scalacss/compare/v0.7.0..v0.8.0-RC1))

* Add support for Scala 3 (`scalatags` module excepted)

* Changed how `scalacss.devOrProdDefaults` works:
  * You can now control it via `sbt -Dscalacss.mode=dev` or `sbt -Dscalacss.mode=prod`
  * Defaults to dev-mode unless in `fullOptJS`

* Upgrade deps
